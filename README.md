# SQL_grocer
A showcase database design for a small online store including database EER model (Grocer.mwb, also EER model.png), the created database (grocerdb.sql), 
and populated tables (under GrocerDumb) as well as an example SQL query (Grocer_testQuery.sql) for retrieving data from multiple tables. Original data: dataset.pdf.

# Project scenario:
Greenspot Grocer is a small online grocery store that is growing rapidly and planning a major expansion. They are currently storing their product data 
in a spreadsheet format that has become unwieldy and will soon be unable to accommodate their growing inventory. 

As a backend developer, examine their current data and design a relational database that will be able to provide the ability to organize and store current data, while providing 
scalability as the business expands its product offerings.

1. Examine the current data and reorganize it to relational table using the modeling tool in MySQL Workbench.
2. Create and load the database with the sample data provided.
3. Test the database design and verify the design by generating SQL JOIN queries.
